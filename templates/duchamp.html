        <h1>Urinals and AI in Art</h1>
        <p>Last updated: June 24, 2025</p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Machines are embedded in art so deeply that we don’t even really notice them. Most writers don’t think it’s a perversion of their work to type it on a computer. Even the most conservative likely doesn’t deactivate the spell check built into Google Docs or Microsoft Word. But that same writer probably rebukes ChatGPT and regards AI-produced writing as second class, in hypotheticals and when they can spot it. They complain with their friends and at conferences about how it makes bad content and defiles the craft and yet is slowly but surely displacing creators in their industry. Fundamentally, a lot of artists don’t regard AI-generated art as art. Some instances of engineering in art are acceptable, though; they might defend the honor of an artist who uses a tool like <em>Procreate</em> to create animations and drawings. They appreciate the daring of a <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/readymade#:~:text=A%20term%20coined%20by%20Marcel,and%20designating%20them%20as%20such." target="_blank">readymade</a> sculpture.</p>
        <p>As the conversation around AI art becomes louder and more frantic, especially after the launches of Veo 3 by Google and 4o Image Generation by OpenAI, I thought it would be interesting to look at Marcel Duchamp’s <em>Fountain</em> (1917), a piece that altered the course of modern art history and forced an expansion of the criteria that define art. Right now, the definition of art is being challenged in some fundamental way - it seems to mean something new and different for algorithms to make art products that we consume. Our social media feeds, ads, and even <a href="https://www.bitforms.art/exhibition/dall-e-artificial-imagination/#artwork-container" target="_blank">galleries</a> are being populated with them rapidly. But the academic definition of art has changed many times. Engineered products aren’t new to art by any stretch of the imagination.  So what’s actually changing now? Is this a bigger and more fundamental shift than those that have come before? How does the intrusion of AI into art making fit into the historical progression of modern art? How does it compare to the shockwaves felt post-<em>Fountain</em>? 
        </p>
        <h3><em>Fountain</em> by Marcel Duchamp (1917)</h3>
        <img src="../static/images/fountain.jpg" alt="Fountain" class="fountain">
        <p><em>Fountain</em> is a porcelain urinal signed “R. Mutt”, submitted for the inaugural exhibition of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gildedage2.omeka.net/exhibits/show/highlights/movements/avantgarde&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1749849231790243&usg=AOvVaw3eLODA_i1o_W0qTH5YTGEU" target="_blank">Society of Independent Artists</a> with Duchamp’s assertion that it is an everyday object “raised to the dignity of a work of art by the artist’s act of choice”. <em>Fountain</em> wasn’t displayed in the show area of the exhibit and the original has been lost. It ended up being displayed in <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267701#:~:text=291%20Fifth%20Avenue%20was%20the,had%20formerly%20been%20Steichen%27s%20studio." target="_blank">Alfred Stieglitz’s studio</a> and published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Man" target="_blank">The Blind Man</a>.</p>
        <p>This work now lives at the heart of the 20th century discussion around what constitutes art, “which more than any other experiment has challenged the boundaries and even the foundations of art as a concept” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/430663" target="_blank">Goldsmith</a>). Although <em>Fountain</em> was initially met with chuckles and repulsion, it ultimately was accepted into museums and displayed on a pedestal, as Duchamp had intended. It locked itself into the course of modern art history and prompted a wave of celebration of everyday objects, sometimes as commentary on consumerism and advertising. Andy Warhol in particular was highly influenced by Duchamp's work: "Therefore, everything seen - every object, that is, plus the process of looking at it - is a Duchamp. Turn it over and it is" (1963).

          </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Relationship to AI</h3>
        <p>The act of creating an art product with generative AI is reminiscent of Duchamp’s process. The user inputs a prompt - their will - to a chatbot, which returns an image. Is the image art, considering that <em>Fountain</em> is? There doesn’t seem to be a huge difference between writing a prompt and receiving a visual representation of it as compared to having a thought and applying it into a pre-engineered urinal and saying that it was your unique human brain that justifies its presentation in a museum. 
        </p>
        <p>I’m sure there are artists and art critics who would disagree with that comparison. The consensus seems to be that Duchamp’s originality was in realizing that there was something to be said about what we accept as art. A person who uses an image generator isn’t doing something for the first time. They’re using it as a tool to circumvent the great struggle associated with developing and applying one’s technical art skills to a paper or block of clay. They’re using it to avoid figuring out every detail of the output, another key element of art of the past. There are a lot of romantic notions about how a painter knows everything that goes onto their canvas and that everything has a purpose. Chekhov’s gun lalala. But AI might put something in your output that you didn’t explicitly ask for or intend. The AI-generated gun won’t necessarily be fired, which defies our expectations as viewers. 
        </p>
        <p>Richard Kuhns, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/429014" target="_blank"> <em>Art and Machine</em></a> (1967), writes that Duchamp’s “discovery” of the readymade introduced two big ideas into art - the engineered itself as an art form and chance as artistic choice. AI in art certainly allows for an appreciation of both the engineered and chance. When we see a startlingly real-looking live <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1924924738494669011" target="_blank">comedy show</a>, we don’t praise the prompter of the video, we praise Gemini’s engineering triumph. Complete precision is impossible - the user doesn’t prompt every pixel. If you ask ChatGPT to paint you a blue sky without specifying the shade, you leave it up to chance. You still imagine a blue sky, but you don’t determine exactly what it ends up looking like. </p>
        <h3>Is AI just a tool?</h3>
        <p>As of now, sort of. NVIDIA’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/ai-art-gallery/" target="_blank">AI Art Gallery</a> site says that artists are using “generative AI as a tool, a collaborator, or a muse to yield creative output that could not have been dreamed of by either entity alone”. In the way that there are painters and sculptors, a new type of artist is emerging - one whose medium is these models. But because AI labs are aiming to create agents not reliant on human intervention, any description of AI as a mere “tool” seems, if not outright deceptive, temporary.</p>
        <p>A big part of what people found disturbing about <em>Fountain</em> was the complete lack of physical intervention by the artist. Duchamp didn’t do much except have the idea, sign the urinal, and show it to people. AI also enables the creation of art with barely any effort on the user’s part. It can do an artist’s whole job nearly end to end. The necessity of writing a prompt and making edits are really the only steps that make AI permissibly describable as a “tool”. But as these agents get better, they’ll be able to eliminate, or at least corrupt, the act of thinking as a step in creation. Don’t know exactly what you want to make? Prompt an LLM for a prompt! AI, if it can’t already, will be able to rob the artist not just of the technical effort of creation but the thinking that they treasure so deeply. It was human thought that made <em>Fountain</em> into a “sculpture” and induced one of the most important inflection points in modern art history - when both the effort of creation and the artistic intentionality aren't human, what’s left?</p>
        <h3>Consumers of art</h3>
        <p>I think it's helpful for this discussion to bucket off the two primary ways that people relate to art: as consumers and producers. Most people have traditionally been consumers: connoisseurs, critics, enjoyers. We listen to music even if we don’t make it. The consumption of art, even without the introduction of AI, is complicated - there’s a lot of discourse about whether you can separate the art from the artist or not, if you enjoy the artwork made by a controversial artist. Kanye West comes to mind. Some people have avoided listening to Kanye because of his anti-Semitism, his relationship with his new wife Bianca, and a host of other ethical failings. But a lot of people still really enjoy his music and play it! He’s done a lot for the music industry over a long and storied career and he hasn’t just been eliminated from fans’ playlists. I’m writing now at a point where AI art hasn’t totally saturated the places we consume art. But it’s getting there. And consumers, though some are very picky, tend to be willing to overlook a lot if they enjoy the product. People are <a href="https://time.com/7266050/toxic-reasons-fall-in-love-with-ai/" target="_blank">falling in love with chatbots</a>  already! As their context windows widen, these models become increasingly capable of making us feel - which for the average painting-looker or music-listener is the gist of what they’re seeking in their day to day interactions with art. If you’re someone who likes art but doesn’t care enormously about where it comes from, AI is the perfect enhancement to your consumption experience. 
        </p>
        <p>Tim Schneider takes a more anti-AI purist perspective in his <a href="https://thegraymarket.substack.com/p/sam-altmans-gentle-singularity-has" target="_blank">Substack post</a> critiquing Sam Altman’s <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity" target="_blank">“The Gentle Singularity”</a>, arguing that ideas and production volume run counter to what makes art great. He writes that we don’t need more art - that we were already drowning in it before generative AI made its production so effortless and thoughtless. He quotes Neal Stephenson on a 2024 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iWHI2S8K5nbj9MqvScLNQ?si=Nbj8GcorQp6eXYSUzKFvNA" target="_blank">podcast</a>. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2rem;">
          “The real purpose of art and the reason we like art is because it exposes us to a very dense package of micro decisions that have been made by the artist. As such, we’re engaged in a communion with that artist. What makes it interesting is that connection. It may be to a living writer, or it may be to a sculptor who died 2,500 years ago, but in either case, we’re making a human-to-human connection. If we know that we’re reading something or experiencing a work of art that was just generated by an algorithm, then that element of human connection isn’t there anymore.”
        </p>
        <p>Schneider believes that tiny choices are what drive us to seek art. AI lets the artist make big choices rather than small ones, hollowing out the meat of the artwork that he argues the viewer is looking for. There are surely thousands of depictions of the crucifixion: the same scene painted or sculpted again and again by artists across centuries and cultures, differentiated only by minute artistics decisions of how to proportion the body on the cross, which characters to include, and the level of agony to portray on Jesus’ face. These choices make each painting vastly different from the next, even though the story is the same.

        <p>So what actually matters to people when they consume art? <em>Fountain</em> proved that what we accept as art has changed over the last century in a fundamental way - nearly everything can be art with very little physical effort by the artist. And although some art lovers are strict about what they look at, anecdotal evidence points to an overwhelming laziness in people on almost everything, especially in their consumption.</p>
        <h3>Producers of art</h3>
        <p>
          Art can be done as a means to an end or as an end in itself. Art as a means to another end is typically sold to clients or submitted for grading in schools - the examples that immediately come to mind for me are graphic design, video creation, and written content. If your goal is to create a certain output by a certain time, it makes sense to use shortcuts to get there faster: AI is the most capable shortcut we’ve ever discovered. Artists who leverage AI to create art products can do their work more quickly and produce higher quantities of it. People who used to commission artists for their work can now skip that expense and make the art themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve historically worshipped the notion of artists doing art as its own end and always taking the long way. Van Gogh didn’t become famous until after he died - he sold one painting during his lifetime, but went on and on at that canvas until he lost his mind and produced some of the most recognizable pieces in the world. 
        </p>
        <p>The people who make art are in a tough spot. Of course, every industry is grappling with the ability of AI to do what they do. But it seems like a big part of what makes artists so defensive of art is that they love the process of creation - a process that is historically slow and personal. You don't get a ton of professional artists who are in it for the money or who want to speed through their work as quickly as possible. On the other hand, not every software engineer truly loves debugging - that’s why so many are now using AI to quit their big tech jobs and make startups. It’s more fun to ship products than to agonize over every line of code. The days of the missing semicolon joke are over. Artists, unlike people who have pursued careers that tend to serve other ends, love to think and struggle - antithetical to the direction that AI is heading. </p>
        <h3>No chat here</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t use AI for this essay because I wanted to sit with it and think about it. It took way longer than it would’ve if I had asked an LLM for ideas or to restructure my notes. I like the struggle associated with writing and knowing that this all came from my head and other authors. There wouldn’t have really been a point in writing this if I had outsourced it to a chatbot. But this is also just for fun and I'm not trying to sell this to you or even perfectly answer my own questions. I didn't want to dirty up my thinking by putting it through a model, which I might've felt differently about if I was just trying to get the piece finished. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If AI is doing something for you, you’re not doing it. And that’s fine - we don’t need to do everything anymore. It makes sense to offload repetitive work and to use it to make stuff more quickly. But we can’t delude ourselves into believing that AI is just helping us “think better”. AI thinks really well and we can ask it to think about our problems and to give us ideas. But looking at the answers to a test and realizing they make sense doesn't mean you got the answers. AI gives us hyperspeed - my favorite writing comes slowly and in small steps. 
        </p>
        <h3>In sum</h3>
        <p>I'd bet that AI-free art will never fully die; some people will always have the urge to create on their own. Artists didn't stop painting after the invention of the camera and didn't stop sculpting after the emergence of the readymade. But running contrary to the deep resistance to automation on the producer's side is apathy and flexibility on the part of the consumer. We like what we like and even if we don't like exactly where it came from, we can pinch our noses. The definition of art has widened before and can again. And the producer, if they want to keep their job, has to give the consumer what they want.
