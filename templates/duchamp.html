        <h1>Urinals and AI in Art</h1>
        <p>June 13, 2025</p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Machines are embedded in art so deeply that we don’t even really notice them. Most writers don’t think it’s a perversion of their work to type it on a computer. Even the most conservative likely doesn’t deactivate the spell check built into Google Docs or Microsoft Word. But that same writer probably rebukes ChatGPT and regards AI-produced writing as second class, in hypotheticals and when they can spot it. They complain with their friends and at conferences about how it makes bad content and defiles the craft and yet is slowly but surely displacing creators in their industry. Fundamentally, a lot of artists don’t regard AI-generated art as art. Some instances of engineering in art are acceptable, though; they might defend the honor of an artist who uses a tool like <em>Procreate</em> to create animations and drawings. They admire the daring of a readymade sculpture.</p>
        <p>As the conversation around AI art becomes louder and more frantic, especially after the launches of Veo 3 by Google and 4o Image Generation by OpenAI, I thought it would be interesting to look closely at Marcel Duchamp’s <em>Fountain</em> (1917), a piece that altered the course of modern art history and forced an expansion of the criteria that define art. Right now, the definition of art is being challenged in some fundamental way - it seems to mean something new and different for algorithms to make art products that we consume. Our social media feeds, ads, and even <a href="https://www.bitforms.art/exhibition/dall-e-artificial-imagination/#artwork-container" target="_blank">galleries</a> are being populated with them rapidly. But the academic definition of art has changed many times. Engineered products aren’t new to art by any stretch of the imagination.  So what’s actually changing now? Is this a bigger and more fundamental shift than those that have come before? How does the intrusion of AI into art making fit into the historical progression of modern art? How does it compare to the shockwaves felt post-<em>Fountain</em>? 
        </p>
        <h3><em>Fountain</em> by Marcel Duchamp (1917)</h3>
        <img src="../static/images/fountain.jpg" alt="Fountain" class="fountain">
        <p><em>Fountain</em> is a porcelain urinal signed “R. Mutt”, submitted for the inaugural exhibition of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gildedage2.omeka.net/exhibits/show/highlights/movements/avantgarde&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1749849231790243&usg=AOvVaw3eLODA_i1o_W0qTH5YTGEU" target="_blank">Society of Independent Artists</a> with Duchamp’s assertion that it is an everyday object “raised to the dignity of a work of art by the artist’s act of choice”. <em>Fountain</em> wasn’t displayed in the show area of the exhibit and the original has been lost. It ended up being displayed in <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267701#:~:text=291%20Fifth%20Avenue%20was%20the,had%20formerly%20been%20Steichen%27s%20studio." target="_blank">Alfred Stieglitz’s studio</a> and published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Man" target="_blank">The Blind Man</a>.</p>
        <p>This work now lives at the heart of the 20th century discussion around what constitutes art, “which more than any other experiment has challenged the boundaries and even the foundations of art as a concept” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/430663" target="_blank">Goldsmith</a>). Although <em>Fountain</em> was initially met with chuckles and repulsion, it ultimately was accepted into museums and displayed on a pedestal, as Duchamp had intended. It locked itself into the course of modern art history and prompted a wave of celebration of everyday objects, sometimes as commentary on consumerism and advertising. For example, Andy Warhol’s iconic <em>Campbell Soup Cans</em> (1962) and Claes Oldenburg’s <em></em>Shuttlecocks</em> (1994).

          </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Relationship to AI</h3>
        <p>The act of creating an art product with generative AI is reminiscent of Duchamp’s process. The user inputs a prompt - their will - to a chatbot, which returns an image. Is the image art, considering that <em>Fountain</em> is? There doesn’t seem to be a huge difference between writing a prompt and receiving a visual representation of it as compared to having a thought and applying it into a pre-engineered urinal and saying that it was your unique human brain that justifies its presentation in a museum. 
        </p>
        <p>I’m sure there are artists and art critics who would disagree with that comparison. The consensus seems to be that Duchamp’s originality was in realizing that there was something to be said about what we accept as art. A person who uses an image generator isn’t doing something for the first time. They’re using it as a tool to circumvent the great struggle associated with developing and applying one’s technical art skills to a paper or block of clay or screen. They’re using it to avoid figuring out every detail of the output, another key element of art of the past. There are a lot of romantic notions about how a painter knows everything that goes onto their canvas and that everything has a purpose. Chekhov’s gun lalala. But AI might put something in your output that you didn’t explicitly ask for or intend. The AI-generated gun won’t necessarily be fired, which defies our expectations as viewers. 
        </p>
        <p>Richard Kuhns, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/429014" target="_blank"> <em>Art and Machine</em></a> (1967), writes that Duchamp’s “discovery” of the readymade introduced two big ideas into art - the engineered itself as an art form and chance as artistic choice. AI in art certainly allows for an appreciation of both the engineered and chance. When we see a startlingly real-looking live <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1924924738494669011" target="_blank">comedy show</a>, we don’t praise the prompter of the video, we praise Gemini’s engineering triumph. Complete precision is impossible - the user doesn’t prompt every pixel. If you ask ChatGPT to paint you a blue sky without specifying the shade, you leave it up to chance. You still imagine a blue sky, but you don’t determine exactly what it ends up looking like. </p>
        <h3>Is AI just a tool?</h3>
        <p>As of now, sort of. NVIDIA’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/ai-art-gallery/" target="_blank">AI Art Gallery</a> site says that artists are “generative AI as a tool, a collaborator, or a muse to yield creative output that could not have been dreamed of by either entity alone”. In the way that there are painters and sculptors, a new type of artist is emerging - one whose medium is these models. But because AI labs are aiming to create agents not reliant on human intervention, any description of AI as a mere “tool” seems, if not outright deceptive, temporary.</p>
        <p>A big part of what people found disturbing about <em>Fountain</em> was the complete lack of physical intervention by the artist. Duchamp didn’t do much except have the idea, sign the urinal, and show it to people. AI also enables the creation of art with barely any effort on the user’s part. It can do an artist’s whole job nearly end to end. The necessity of writing a prompt and making edits are really the only steps that make AI permissibly describable as a “tool”. But as these agents get better, they’ll be able to eliminate, or at least corrupt, the act of thinking as a step in creation. Don’t know exactly what you want to make? Prompt an LLM for a prompt! AI, if it can’t already, will be able to rob the artist not just of the technical effort of creation but the thinking that they treasure so deeply. It was human thought that made <em>Fountain</em> into a “sculpture” and induced one of the most important inflection points in modern art history - when both the effort of creation and the artistic intentionality are not human, what’s left?</p>
        <h3>Anti-AI purism and reimaginations</h3>
        <p>
          To be clear, AI art can be cool - for example, there are a lot of interesting applications of AI in reimagining famous art pieces. Here are two iterations on Grant Wood’s iconic American Gothic: <a href="https://superrare.com/artwork/eth/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/46212" target="_blank">VIRTUAL AMERICAN GOTHIC</a> by gala_mirissa and <a href="https://nettricegaskins.medium.com/new-american-gothic-the-great-migration-not-like-us-the-future-6fb7b526995e" target="_blank">New American Gothic</a>, created on Midjourney by Nettrice Gaskins and included in her Medium blog post. If AI is being used as a tool to further an interesting, human-conceived idea like that presented by Gaskins, people tend to be receptive. They are much more averse to the idea of an agent devising and executing an idea all on its own. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is funny because ideas aren’t everything in art - sometimes the physical effort is. Over the centuries, there have been thousands of depictions of the crucifixion: the same scene painted or sculpted again and again by different people in different places. There’s a camp of artists who would be much more likely to celebrate a human-painted crucifixion than an AI-generated depiction of something entirely new. But everyone has to pay the bills and if you’re a graphic designer, your client base is likely shrinking unless you’re saddling the AI stallion and using your proprietary artistic knowledge spurs to ride it off into the sunset. 
        </p>
        <p>
          AI-free art will never fully die; people will always have the urge to create on their own. I didn’t use AI for this essay because I wanted to read for it and think about it. It took way longer than it would’ve if I had asked an LLM for ideas or to restructure my notes. But the kind of art that artists sell to clients and submit for grading in schools - graphic design, video creation, and writing, for example - are all just a prompt away from the people who used to pay humans for those services. The resistance among artists to letting AI “corrupt” what they do is strong - a combination of anxiety about their livelihoods and a moral opposition to shortcutting artistic traditions. And that resistance isn’t new, but a descendant of the existential tussle with machinery that Kuhns explored in 1967.
